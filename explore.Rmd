This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for testing reproducibility in science. 

```{r}
# data wrangling
# read.csv ideally takes cares of data type, but some times it fails to recognize the values.
# Your NA strings in the csv file, N/A, are interpreted as character and then the whole column is converted to character(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20060706).
greenhouse_data <- read.csv('data/Greenhouse_data_TH/het data-Table 1.csv',header = TRUE,as.is = TRUE,na.strings = "n/a")
str(greenhouse_data)
```

Lets do some summary statistics of data elements
```{r}
summary(greenhouse_data)
```
```{r}
# Lets look at avaliable treatments
unique(greenhouse_data$treatment)
```

```{r}
# In the experiment, these are the treatment groups, but what are those , and why are they here.
# Lets look at the researcher's real question - "I wanted to know whether these differences in responses to shading can be traced back to differences inlight availability in the ﬁeld". So, to setup the scenarios so to speak, she needed to simulate different growing conditions

#c, control; he, heterogeneous shading; ho, homogeneous shading



# 
```

Finding - Time to ﬁrst ﬂowering is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the light environment in the source populations

```{r}
# For our purpose, we will consider one question
# Time to ﬁrst ﬂowering was determined as the number of days between planting and ﬁrst ﬂowering



```

We have data, and we want to emulate the researcher's result. Because we have lot of observations per treatment group, we need a metric, 'mean' is commonly used, i.e. sum of observations(pick the variable of interest) divided by number of observations

```{r}
# Note - na.rm	a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.
mean.c <- mean(greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='c','first.flower'],na.rm=TRUE)
mean.he <- mean(greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='he','first.flower'],na.rm=TRUE)
mean.ho <- mean(greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='ho','first.flower'],na.rm=TRUE)

treatmentxflowering_means <- c(mean.c,mean.he,mean.ho)
treatmentxflowering_means
# W
```

```{r}
# Do a box plot to confirm your means
boxplot(first.flower~treatment,data=greenhouse_data, main="Shading effects on flowering", 
  	xlab="Shading treatments", ylab="Time to flower (days)")
```
At this stage we could state that 'he' is mostly influencing the time to flower, hence ...., but as researchers like to be confident in their findings, they attest it by doing a statistical test which gives a probability that the results were not by chance.

One such test where we have to compare two means, is t-test
```{r}
t.test(greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='c','first.flower'],greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='he','first.flower'],alternative = "two.sided",conf.level = 0.95)
```
We look for two key values - p-value, for now - think that lower than .05 is better (chance of getting this result by random chance). So, we have a 'Measure of the probable truth' (O.N.Bishop) that not subjective.

```{r}
se <- function(x) sqrt(var(x,na.rm = TRUE)/length(x))
treatmentxflowering_se <- c(se(greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='c','first.flower']),
                            se(greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='he','first.flower']),
                            se(greenhouse_data[greenhouse_data$treatment=='ho','first.flower']))

top_SE <- max(treatmentxflowering_means+treatmentxflowering_se*2)
treatments <- c("c", "he", "ho")
barCenters <- barplot(treatmentxflowering_means, names.arg=treatments, col="gray", las=1, ylim=c(0,top_SE))
```

Now, the researcher also looked at height, and leaf length. Lets explore that next.
```{r}

```
