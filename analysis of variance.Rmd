This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for exploring analysis of variance. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Analysis of variance is commonly used where you have treatment groups, and you are testing the effect of a variable across the treatment groups. Here, we will use the greenhouse data from the shading experiment, and as we have groups classified with various treatments, we will explore the effects on these treatment groups. 

```{r}
greenhouse_data <- read.csv('data/Greenhouse_data_TH/het data-Table 1.csv',header = TRUE,as.is = TRUE,na.strings = "n/a")
str(greenhouse_data)
```

Lets check the effect of treatments to seeds per fruit. 
```{r}
lmphan<- lm(data=greenhouse_data, greenhouse_data$seeds.per.fruit~greenhouse_data$treatment)
anova(lmphan)
```

```{r}
summary(lmphan)
```

Our hypothesis that the treatment effects the seeds per fruit is not supported as our p-value is much higher than 0.05. Remember, we had three treatment groups, and we are interested to find out if the treatments had any effect on seeds.

We load another package 'lmne4', which can assist us with assesing effects. In tackling this sort of questions, we have to keep in mind what kind of variable is we are interested in when looking at the effects. We could see this as discrete and continuous also, in our example we had three treatment groups - He, Ho, and Control, so we can infer them as discrete. In the literature, it is referred to as Fixed or Random effects. Our treatment groups would be classified as 'Fixed' effects. To show additionally the effect of a Random variable, we add the source population of the plants.

```{r}
library(lme4)
lmerex <- lmer(seeds.per.fruit ~ treatment + (1|source.fam),data=greenhouse_data)
anova(lmerex)
summary(lmerex)
```
