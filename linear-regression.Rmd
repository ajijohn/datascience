This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for exploring linear regression. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

We would at times want to measure how two parameters of interest are connnected, lets explore a dataset of ours to explore that. We will use the glasshouse data in the shading experiment.
```{r}
greenhouse_data <- read.csv('data/Greenhouse_data_TH/het data-Table 1.csv',header = TRUE,as.is = TRUE,na.strings = "n/a")
str(greenhouse_data)
```
Do the summary statistics to get a sense of the data
```{r}
summary(greenhouse_data)

```
We could explore the relationship between leaf length and height of the plant, and see if there is any correlation.

Best way to visualize it first by doing a simple plot, think of normal cartersian coordinates and we do point plotting(x,y). Recollect what x & y would mean with regards to dependent and independent variables.

```{r}
plot(data=na.omit(greenhouse_data), x=greenhouse_data$leaf.length, y=greenhouse_data$height,
     main="Shading effects on plant height", xlab="Leaf length", ylab="Plant height")

#TODO omit the n/A rows
abline(lm(greenhouse_data$height ~ greenhouse_data$leaf.length))
```
When we interpret the linear regression line, we look to see the direction of line, it has four possibilities; no correlation(its all evenly spread point cloud), going upward, going downward, and parallel to x-axis/y-axis. If it is not parallel to either of the axis, we could confidently say that there is no explained variation of y because of x.

Linear regression gives a way to measure correlation, and most prevalent way is to give it as a coorelation coefficient. R gives us a way to extract that for two variables.
```{r}
 # Looks like very ideal linear positive relationship, but we ought to be not subjective.
lm(data=greenhouse_data, greenhouse_data$height~greenhouse_data$leaf.length)

```
Lets inspect it more, and need to invoke summary() function to get correlation coefficient. 
```{r}
 # Looks like very ideal linear positive relationship, but we ought to be not subjective.
summary(lm(data=greenhouse_data, greenhouse_data$height~greenhouse_data$leaf.length))
lmph<- lm(data=greenhouse_data, greenhouse_data$height~greenhouse_data$leaf.length)
```
Ideally, coorelation coefficient is squared, so what you see R give out is R-squared, which is basically square of correlation coeffcient.

```{r}

opar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2), oma = c(0, 0, 1.1, 0))
plot(lmph, las = 1)      # Residuals, Fitted, ...
par(opar)
```
