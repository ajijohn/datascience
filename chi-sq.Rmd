This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook to cover basic statistics required for Biology, and infact for doing some scrappy datascience. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

First we need to have a question, how/why/what something happens. It is a fundamental curiosity which invokes the hypothesis. A hypothesis is a claim which you are unsure of or want to seek answer to by observation or by doing experiments.

In this notebook; we cover two types of application of Chi-Sq, like other statistical tests, we are trying to ascertain if the results of the experiement is by chance or there is a real phenomena behind.

The first type is where we look to see if the sample pulled from a population is following a probability or a proportion described by a theory. It is also called test of homogeneity aka all of the same kind (ref Zar), Mandelian genetics theory falls into that;

Lets take an example from the class about Mendelian genetics. Parents (YYRR * ggww)  -> F1(YgRw). We expect the secong generation(F2) cross to follow 9(YR):3(Yw):3(gR):1(gw) ratio.  Example Adapted from Zar (Biostatistics)

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(2504,853,881,292), ncol = 4)
chisq.test(x, p = c(9/16,3/16,3/16,1/16))

```
As p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject our null hypothesis that the observed frequency follows Mendelian theory.

Another example on the same line.


F1 generation cross between two strains of Drosophilia(Fruit flies), there were 37 female flies, and 47 male flies. The expected sex ratio was 1 male: 1 female. Does the observed ratio differ significantly from the expectation. (Stat for Biology - O.N.Bishop).

----------------------------
          Female   |  Male
----------------------------
          | 37       |  47
----------------------------

Here we can use the Chi-square test to see if there is a deviation from the expected.

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(37,47), ncol = 2)
chisq.test(x, p = c(.5,0.5))
```
As p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject our null hypothesis that their would equal number of male and female in F1 cross.

Now, lets try to test our Mendelian theory by different set of experimental results.

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(152,39,53,6), ncol = 4)
chisq.test(x, p = c(9/16,3/16,3/16,1/16))
```

What do you conclude now ?

Another variation of Chi-Sq is where yoou need to find if the observations were random, or it is signifying an underlying process.  Example from ON Bishop, 5 traps were set out in the woods, and one trap caught fewer than the others, we need to find out if it was by chance or something actual; this might be an actual experiment which you were doing to collect the subjecs for the test.

------------------------------------------------
            A   |   B   |  C  | D     | E
------------------------------------------------
           23   |  7    | 25  | 19    | 21
------------------------------------------------

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(23,7,25,19,21), ncol = 5)
chisq.test(x, p = c(1/5,1/5,1/5,1/5,1/5))
```
Null hypothesis being all the traps are same(homegeneous), and by the p-value, we inferred that it is not the same. The chance is given by the p-vale, i.e. p-value is 0.032, that is to say that there is 3% chance that the null hypothesis is true, which by our established standards is ok (less than 5%), hence, we can accept the results as significant.
